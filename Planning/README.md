## Project Description

For project four I will be creating a catalog/blog for handmade crafts. Users will login and sign up with a custom username and password. If user is a member and part of the community "Fatansy Foami" (site's name), complete access to tutorials will be granted. However and in the case a user wouldnt want to sign up nor have an account with "Fantasy Foami", access to customized crafts (requesting price, comments and or likes) will be granted but tutorials won't be available for them. User will be able to comment every single product according to their experience based on delivery and overall look of the item, allowing them to iteract with more users.
A separate page and special access will be given to the editor of the site to update, create, delete products and descriptions for tutorials as well as pictures shown within this section.
